      <br>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:medium; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">The JDM explosion in the late '70s, '80s,'90s, and early 2000s gave car enthusiasts some truly sensational machines. These include the R32-R34 generation Nissan Skyline GT-R, the Ayrton Senna-inspired Honda NSX, and the legendary Toyota Supra. Not forgetting, we also got the Colin McRae-driven Subaru Impreza and a certain rotary-powered screamer from Mazda called the RX-7.  These were some of the most tuner-friendly sports cars from the land of the rising sun. They built a reputation that made them JDM cult classics with massive followings even today.</p>

This was in a little village surrounded by picturesque countryside and rolling hills. Growing up on farmland, there weren't many cars, but his father owned a truck and was a mechanic, which gave Nagata an early interest in machinery.

        Smokey Nagata discovered he loved modifying machines from an early age, and he began working with small engines at his home. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
